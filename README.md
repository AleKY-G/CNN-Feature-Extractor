# CNN Feature Extractor  

- This code can be used to extract the CNN penultimate layer feature vectors from the state-of-the-art Convolutional neural network architectures
which are trained on 1 million ImageNet images.  

- The code shows the example of using RESNET-152 version 2. But it can be easily modified to use a different CNN architectures, provided in the models folder, which are originally developed by Tensorflow-slim authors.   
    - ResNet 152 v2
    - ResNet 152 v1
    - VGG16
